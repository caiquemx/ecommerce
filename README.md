# Ecommerce Project
  This is a generic project developed using REACT and an e-commerce API from MERCADO LIVRE (https://developers.mercadolivre.com.br/pt_br/itens-e-buscas).
  
  Despite of using a pt-br API, I wrote the entire project in english such as this README, so you can see how my english is.
  
# Lessons Learned

  At first was simple to build the first page with some HTML tags and css, but quickly it got harder with event handler function
  and parent components needing props. I am sure there are lot to improve and refactor, certainly with the context API.
  
  However in this project I could study and use some front-end concepts such as:
  
    - React Hooks;
    - React Context API;
    - Async/await functions;
    - Generic components;
    - Components life-cycle;
    - Pure CSS;
    - Event handler functions.
